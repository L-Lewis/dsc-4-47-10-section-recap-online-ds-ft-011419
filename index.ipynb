    "* Autoencoders are unsupervised neural networks that are useful in the context of data compression\n",
    "* Autoencoders are networks that have the same input and output, while compressing the input into a lower-dimensional code called the summary or \"representation\"\n",
    "* The compressed representation can be seen as a \"bottleneck\"\n",
    "* Except for being useful for compressing the input and reconstructing the output, the hidden layer in an autoencoder can also be useful to learn something useful about the hidden data\n",
    "* There are 4 AE Hyperparameters that we need to set before training an autoencoder: code size, number of layers, number of nodes per layer, and loss function\n",
    "* Just like with other neural networks, you can have simple, shallow autoencoders and deep autoencoders\n",
    "* Denoising Autoencoders (DAEs) are used to denoise input data and creating \"clean\" outputs\n",
    "* Convolutional Autoencoders combine the use cases of CNNs and autoencoders by providing solutions for image reconstruction and image colorization\n",
